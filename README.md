# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java runtime exception: `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element outside its valid index range, causing this exception.  The `bugSolution.java` file shows how to fix this problem by correctly handling array indices within the bounds of the array.

## How to Reproduce

1. Compile and run `bug.java`.
2. Observe the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` being thrown.

## Solution

The solution involves checking the array index before accessing the element.  Refer to `bugSolution.java` for the corrected code.
